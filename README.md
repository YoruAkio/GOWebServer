Building the server is simple, just run the following command:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository and its submodules for the requirements of geo location detection
git clone https://github.com/yoruakio/GOWebServer.git --recursive
```

2. Build the server:

```bash
go build

# or running the go file directly
go run main.go
```

3. Run the server:

```bash
./GOWebServer
```
